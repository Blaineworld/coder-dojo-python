### alpha 1
```
+ Added a changelog. (Hi!)
+ Began adding 6-digit displays and button panels to microwave ovens, available via MicrowaveOven.read() and MicrowaveOven.press() respectively.
+ The code now has more comments.
+ The error messages are now more descriptive, AND EVEN MORE EXCLAMATORY!!!
+ There is now an error message for when an object could not be inserted because it is unavailable.
+ You can now take items out of containers.
* ContainerApplianceWithDoor.closed is now ContainerApplianceWithDoor.shut
* Microwaves are now microwave ovens with microwave as a shorthand so it makes more sense.
* Minor changes to my code that you don't really need to know about.
* PyKitchen now declares a lot of stuff inside of a function as an attempt to create variables and methods that are as private as possible.
* The error message for an object not being a Thing is now prioritized over the one for the container being unavailable when inserting an object into a container.
* The error messages now say "unavailable" instead of "not available."
* The error messages now use variables for parts that are the same in a lot of them to keep file size reasonable.
* Tweaked some physics values on certain objects.
~ Things are no longer always unavailable when not in a container.
